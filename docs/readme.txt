=====================
MiH Item Pack for BG1
=====================

This component installs the Made in Heaven item pack for Baldur's Gate 1.
Most of these will be found at Brokk's Forge, a new shop at the Friendly
Arm Inn (in the previously unused house on the left side).  The dwarf
Brokk sells a number of unique items in his shop and can create a few new
ones from things you find elsewhere.  Be sure to check back with him now and
then!

Others will be found on enemies both old and new.  Some may replace others
that I felt were either too strong or too weak for where they appear.  But
don't worry, you can still find the old item elsewhere.  And a few have been
placed in dungeons, mostly the Candlekeep catacombs and Durlag's Tower.


// ===============================
// Potions of Extra Healing in BG1
// ===============================

Like the name suggests, this modification makes Potions of Extra Healing
available at the Sword Coast.  You'll find some for sale in major temples and
in a few select stores.

For vanilla BG1, this mod will create potn52.itm from potn08.itm, with
graphics lifted from BG2.


================
Cathline's Peril
================

This mini-quest was written as a favor to a friend and features their
character, the elven priestess Cathline.  My friend also provided the new
art used in this little encounter.

Cathline can be found in the previously occupied house near the High Hedge.
But she's a woman alone and there are monsters in the area...


====================
The Surgeon's Plight
====================

The Surgeon is an interesting character, but is only met once in the game.
This modification adds two more encounters with him, one in Cloakwood before
the confrontation with Davaeorn in the mine, and another at the Friendly Arm
Inn after it is all done.  The only condition is that you must already have
met The Surgeon at the Sword Coast and must have gotten him to tell his story.
I feel this provides a bit more closure to the story.


===================
Enhanced Ankheg Pit
===================

This component greatly increases the number of ankhegs in the ankheg pit near
farmer Brun's farm.  They will no longer wait for you to fight them one at a
time, but come at you in groups.  Better be prepared.

There is also some minor restored content, a Ruby Ring (ring19) was placed in
the treasure hoard.  A transition in farmer Brun's dialog suggests this was
originally supposed to be there.

=======================
Enhanced Ulcaster Ruins
=======================

This component adds a few extra encounters to the Ulcaster Ruins, including a
new type of undead enemy, the Blazing Bones.  You might want to pack some fire
resistance...

Blazing Bones are the undead remains of wizards or priests who were killed by
fire while having Contingency spells prepared to preserve their life.  They
now hate all life and see their flames as a means to cleanse the world.


======================
Enhanced Xvart Village
======================

This component seeks to make the Xvart Village area west of Nashkel a bit more
of a challenge.  It's still not that hard, but you can expect the xvarts to
put up much more of a fight in the defense of their homes.

List of changes:
- Number of xvarts at the north- and south entrances has doubled.
- The xvarts now have a few low-level spellcasters for backup.
- Nexlit the Xvart is a full-fledged 4th level fighter.
- A few minor traps have been added to the area.


====================
Creature Corrections
====================

Many of BG1's creatures are sloppily defined.  Well over 300 of them have no
proper alignment set (as in none at all, not even neutral) and several more
have alignments that do not match their P&P description (for monsters) or
actions (for humanoids).

Additionally, several monsters were missing their proper attacks, or
implemented them in a bad way.  This component seeks to address all of those.

The alignment part has been externalized (idea borrowed from CamDawg), if you
don't agree with my changes or feel I overlooked something you can edit
config/bg1_alignment_changes.tpa before installing this component.


===============
Missing Dialogs
===============

A lot of characters in BG1 (most notably many commoners in Baldur's Gate) have
dialog files that do not exist, or don't have any dialog assigned at all.
Others have dialogs that sometimes has no valid states (usually after quests
have been completed or a certain point in the game is reached).  This component
adds some flavor text to such characters.


===================
Shop Fixes & Tweaks
===================

The main thing that this component does is replace the unrealistically large
stacks of Large Shields +1 that some shops (most notably the Friendly Arm
Inn and the Nashkel shop) carry.  At the Sword Coast magic items are
relatively uncommon, and it makes no sense that a shop carrying otherwise
mundane equipment should have a stack of five enchanted large shields.  I
consider this more a bug fix than a tweak.

Another thing this component does is add a few copies of hard to get items
to the Thunderhammer smithy.  These are the War hammer +1, Long Bow +1 and
Splint Mail +1.  A Large Shield +1 is also available, to make up for the fact
that other shops no longer carry it.

This component also adds a few 4th level spell scrolls to Thalantyr's
inventory, so your 7th level wizard will no longer be running around without
any spells to fill their 4th level slot until you finish Cloakwood.  In
addition, Thalantyr will also have a Bracers of Defense A.C. 7 for sale.

Finally this component moves two items that seem out of place in the
Thunderhammer Smithy to Black Lily's store in the thieves' guild in Baldur's
Gate instead.  These are the Shadow Armor +3 and the Dagger of Venom.


=======================
BG1 Miscelaneous Tweaks
=======================

This is a collection of small tweaks and enhancements to make certain aspects
of BG1 more convenient or simply more interesting.  Some of these might
perhaps be turned into full enhancements and given their own component in the
future, but for now they are collected here.

The list of changes:
- Chase at the Lion's Way and Fahrington in the Spider Wood tend to blend into
  the background if you don't have blue circles on.  This moves them slightly
  to a position where they stand out more.  (And in Chase's case, also feels
  more appropriate to his drama queen dialog.)
- The ranger Gerde in the Fishing Village does not spawn until you have talked
  to Fenten in Baldur's Gate.  The ankhegs she wants you to kill spawn after
  talking to her (east and a bit north of her).  There will be six of them, so
  watch out.  Finally, her trigger to see if you did her quest has been
  changed to one that is (hopefully) more reliable.
- The Talos-worshipping fishermen won't turn hostile through dialog anymore.
  This prevents them from needlessly being mowed down by your party AI scripts
  kicking in after the quest has been resolved.  (They will still go hostile
  if attacked.)
- Farmer Brun won't run into the woods anymore if you happen to fight ankhegs
  near him.
- The ankheg north of Tenya's hut won't spawn until after you talked to Quinn
  in Baldur's Gate.  Nester's dagger (dagg06) has been given a unique icon
  (lifted from Icewind Dale) and description to make it stand out a bit more.
  (And yes, it really is a masterwork dagger now.  No, you can't get it
  enchanted.)
- Hentold's Quest uses a unique dagger (with an icon lifted from Icewind Dale)
  instead of the supposedly one of a kind Heart of the Golem.  This is a bit
  of a restoration of sorts as the unique dagger (dagg08) was already in the
  game.  I did make it a little more tempting to keep it, though...
  (I might turn this into a full quest enhancement sometime, with the revenant
  stalking you if you keep the dagger...)


==================================================
Allow Divine Spell Scrolls to Paladins and Rangers
==================================================

This component allows paladins and rangers in Icewind Dale to use respectively
cleric- and druid scrolls, simple as that.


========================
Improved Healing Potions
========================

The Potion of Extra Healing and Spirit Essence in Icewind Dale are much weaker
than their counterparts in Baldur's Gate 2.  This component makes them
equivalent to their BG2 versions, 27 HP for a Potion of Healing (was 16) and
40 HP for a Spirit Essence (was 25).  This makes the game a little easier.

Alternatively this mod allows you to set your own custom value for both
potions.


========================================
Wear Protective Items with Magical Armor
========================================

This component removes all armor from itemexcl.2da.  This allows you to equip
Rings of Protection and the like with magical armor, but you still can't
combine a Ring of Protection with a Cloak of Protection.  This makes both
protection items and magical armor a lot more useful, especially in Baldur's
Gate 1.

A little trivia: Achieving this was why I started modding in the first
place. :-)


===============================
Enforce Druid Item Restrictions
===============================

Baldur's Gate is a little loose with the druid's vows, especially for
fighter-druids.  This component tightens up the rules, druids and
fighter-druids will no longer be able to wear armor, helms and shields forged
from metal.  You'll want that ankheg plate and dragon scale now!

This makes things harder for druids and especially fighter-druids, but I feel
it does the spirit of the class more justice.  To compensate, my Item Packs
contain some new items that druids can use.

If you feel that some items should not be changed by this component, you can
put their resrefs (filename minus the .itm extention) in the file
config/druid_item_exceptions.txt before installing this component.


==========================
Alternative Druid XP Table
==========================

Tired of your druid being stuck at level 14 while the rest of your party is
gaining epic abilities left and right?  This component will reduce the
ridiculously high 3 million XP speed bump at level 15 to a much more sane
value, and progresses from there.  From level 15 onward, druids will gain
levels at a speed somewhere between a cleric and a fighter.


==========================
Level-locked Spell Scrolls
==========================

This component restricts spell scrolls by level, so low-level clerics and
mages are no longer able to cast spells far beyond their normal ability from
scrolls.  A cleric or wizard will only be able to cast a spell that is up to
one level above their normal ability from a scroll, so a 5th level wizard (3rd
level spells) could use an Ice Storm (4th) scroll, but not a Cloudkill (5th)
scroll.  Scribing new spells into a spellbook is not restricted due to an
engine limitation.

This component does not work with the original Baldur's Gate and Icewind dale,
the BG2 engine or better is required.


=========================================
More Versatile Bucklers and Small Shields
=========================================

Implementing a house rule of a GM friend of mine, this component allows mages
to use bucklers and thieves to use small shields.  I feel this makes bucklers
and small shields a little more useful than they normally are.

Note: In the BG games there are no separate item types for bucklers and small-,
medium- and large shields.  This modification checks their animation to tell
the difference.  Unfortunately this means that some mod-added bucklers that use
a different animation, like those from Rogue Rebalancing, whill not be affected.
This is not an issue in IWD where shields do have separate item types.


========================
Alternative Stat Bonuses
========================

Under D&D 2E rules (which BG and IWD use), for most stats a character had to
have at least a 16 or higher score to notice any tangible effect.  There was
no difference between a 10, 12 or 14 except in how easy it was to get up to
16.  In 3E rules this was changed so that stats started having an effect at a
score of 12 or higher.

This component implements a hybrid of the 2E and 3E rules (since full 3E is
not possible within the engine).  Characters will notice an effect from a
score of 12 or higher in a stat, and the effects of extremely high stats (19
or more) are tempered somewhat.


======================
Extended HP Dice Rolls
======================

Under 2E rules, characters stopped rolling dice for HP after level 9.  3E
extended this to level 20.  This component implements the 3E rule.

This component should play nice with the various options for HP dice of
CamDawg's Tweak Anthologies.


=========================================
Relative Stat Bonuses from Equipped Items
=========================================

Several items, most notable the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength and the Gloves of
Dexterity, set a certain stat to a fixed score while equipped.  This opens a
number of exploits, allowing a character to get a huge stat increase from a
single item while at the same time making the item nearly useless to
characters that already have a decent score in that stat.

This mod makes such items more like their 3E counterparts where they give a
bonus to a stat score instead.  The conversion is as follows:

	18	=> +2
	19, 20	=> +3
	21, 22	=> +4
	23, 24	=> +5
	25	=> +6

Items with a limited duration (like potions) and spells are not affected.


============================
Non-Bouncing Lightning Bolts
============================

Tired of wizards killing themselves with wildly bouncing bolts of lightning?
This component alters all items that use the bouncing projectile to use a
different one.  There are two options:

Bolt from the Sky:
This makes a precision strike on a single creature, like the druid's Call
Lightning spell except that it can be indoors and the wizard does not get
multiple bolts.

Line of Lightning:
This uses a projectile similar to the old one except that it stops when
reaching a wall instead of bouncing off.

Due to engine limitations, the original Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale can
only use the Bolt from the Sky option.


================
Cap Item Charges
================

This component caps the number of charges in wands, staves and the like to
20, or a user-defined value.


===================
Arcane Spell Tweaks
===================

This component is a small collection of minor tweaks to a number of arcane
spells.

- Shield:
  Grants +2 AC instead of base AC 4.  (Not cumulative with itself.)
  This also affects the Shield Amulet, and the Ring of Shielding in Icewind
  Dale.

- Protection from Normal Missiles:
  Also grants +25% missile damage resistance to missiles it doesn't outright
  block.

- Disintegrate:
  Will still deal 5d6 damage if the target makes a successful saving throw.


===================
Divine Spell Tweaks
===================

This component is a small collection of minor tweaks to a number of divine
spells.

- Shillelagh:
  The shillelagh counts as a magical weapon with a +1 enchantment and deals
  2d4 damage.
  In Icewind Dale this is already the default, no change there.

- Barkskin:
  Barkskin grants an AC bonus of +2 to +5 instead of setting a fixed base AC,
  and is not cumulative with itself.
  This also affects the Staff of the Woodlands in BG2.

- Flame Blade:
  The flame blade deals pure fire damage and improves with level, like the 3E
  version.  It is also +4 to hit and counts as a +2 weapon for purposes of
  what it can hit.  The flame blade is wielded as a scimitar, but there is no
  penalty for non-proficiency.


=======================
Improved Healing Spells
=======================

This component alters healing spells to act like their 3E counterparts.

- Cure Light Wounds:	1d8 + 1/level (max. +5)
- Cure Medium Wounds:	2d8 + 1/level (max. +10)
- Cure Moderate Wounds:	3d8 + 1/level (max. +15)
- Cure Serious Wounds:	4d8 + 1/level (max. +20)
- Cure Critical Wounds:	5d8 + 1/level (max. +25)
- Heal:			10/level (no max.)

This makes healing spells more random and a bit weaker at the start of BG1 and
IWD1, but in the long run much more effective, and a more viable choice
compared to other spells.

This component will find Cure Medium/Moderate spells added by mods, like
IWDification for BG2, provided that they are properly added to spell.ids.


=========================
Additional Paladin Powers
=========================

This component gives paladins a few more innate powers.

- Paladins that can Lay on Hands (true-class Paladin and Cavalier) get an
  additional use every seventh paladin level, up to 5/day at level 28.
- All paladins except the Undead Hunter can Smite Evil, this deals 1d6 points
  of magical damage to a single evil creature.  Every third paladin level
  raises the damage by another 1d6, up to 11d6 at level 30.  Every fifth
  paladin level gives another use per day, up to 5/day at level 20.
- Undead Hunters can Smite Undead.  This only works on undead creatures, but
  it works regardless of alignment.  Other than that it functions the same as
  Smite Evil.

The Smite Evil/Undead ability was based on Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter.

Currently this component only works on games with the BG2/ToB engine.


=======================
No Resist Fire/Ice Icon
=======================

This component patches items and spells to no longer display the Resist
Fire/Ice icon.  Instead, if the item or spell grants 20% or more fire
resistance, it will display the Protection from Fire icon, and likewise for
Protection from Cold.

I wrote this because the Resist Fire/Ice icon is ugly and nearly impossible to
tell apart from Protection from Fire in modern resolutions.


=======================
Other Item Improvements
=======================

This is a small collection of changes and (hopefully) improvements to items
that are shared by BG1, BG2 and IWD1.  The list is as follows:

- Potion of Invulnerability (potn11):
  This potion now works as the P&P version, granting +2 to AC and saves, and
  immunity to normal weapons.
- Elixer of Health (potn17):
  This potion will now also cure blindness and deafness.
- Wand of Magic Missiles (wand03):
  This wand will fire two magic missiles now, as per P&P.
  (The BG1 version of wand12 is deliberately left untouched.)
- Wand of Lightning (wand07):
  Now fires just one lightning bolt instead of six.  (BG2 only)
