@1    = ~You are very noble to save that poor creature from its stone prison, <CHARNAME>.  But I don't think we should expect any thanks.  Let's keep our distance.~
@2    = ~Boo says that even though you saved it, we should keep away from this cranky bear, <CHARNAME>.  Even Boo himself would hesitate to approach it, and he's a very brave hamster.~
@3    = ~A waste of a good scroll that could have been used to save a far worthier target!  (Like me, for instance.)~
@4    = ~I wonder if anyone will remember us in song for saving a cranky bear?~
@5    = ~Saved A Bear
