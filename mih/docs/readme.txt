=====================
MiH Item Pack for BG1
=====================

This component installs the Made in Heaven item pack for Baldur's Gate 1.
Most of these will be found at Brokk's Forge, a new shop at the Friendly
Arm Inn (in the previously unused house on the left side).  The dwarf
Brokk sells a number of unique items in his shop and can create a few new
ones from things you find elsewhere.  Be sure to check back with him now and
then!

Others will be found on enemies both old and new.  Some may replace others
that I felt were either too strong or too weak for where they appear.  But
don't worry, you can still find the old item elsewhere.  And a few have been
placed in dungeons, mostly the Candlekeep catacombs and Durlag's Tower.


// ===============================
// Potions of Extra Healing in BG1
// ===============================

Like the name suggests, this modification makes Potions of Extra Healing
available at the Sword Coast.  You'll find some for sale in major temples and
in a few select stores.

For vanilla BG1, this mod will create potn52.itm from potn08.itm, with
graphics lifted from BG2.


================
Cathline's Peril
================

This mini-quest was written as a favor to a friend and features their
character, the elven priestess Cathline.  My friend also provided the new
art used in this little encounter.

Cathline can be found in the previously occupied house near the High Hedge.
But she's a woman alone and there are monsters in the area...


====================
The Surgeon's Plight
====================

The Surgeon is an interesting character, but is only met once in the game.
This modification adds two more encounters with him, one in Cloakwood before
the confrontation with Davaeorn in the mine, and another at the Friendly Arm
Inn after it is all done.  The only condition is that you must already have
met The Surgeon at the Sword Coast and must have gotten him to tell his story.
I feel this provides a bit more closure to the story.


===================
Enhanced Ankheg Pit
===================

This component greatly increases the number of ankhegs in the ankheg pit near
farmer Brun's farm.  They will no longer wait for you to fight them one at a
time, but come at you in groups.  Better be prepared.

There is also some minor restored content, a Ruby Ring (ring19) was placed in
the treasure hoard.  A transition in farmer Brun's dialog suggests this was
originally supposed to be there.


=============================
Enhanced Candlekeep Catacombs
=============================

For a near endgame dungeon, the Candlekeep Catacombs are actually pretty tame.
This mods seeks to up the epicness a few notches by putting some more
resistance there.  Expect more and stronger undead when you examine the tombs,
and more dopplegangers when you try to make your escape.

There is one minor restored encounter with a doppleganger version of Erik, one of
<CHARNAME>'s trainers in the tutorial level.  I also added two original
doppleganger encounters with other tutorial characters.

Lastly, Arkanis and Deder will now be much better prepared for their task,
and you will get full control over them if they decide to help your party.


==================
Enhanced Cloakwood
==================

The main effect of this modification is that you will encounter far more
spiders in the second section of the forest.  The number of phase- and sword
spiders has been doubled.  There will also be far more spiders in Centeol's
lair, so be prepared!

The second-, third- and fourth sections will also each feature a restored
encounter that was cut from the original game.  Can you help Olivia realize
her dream of flight?  Will you find Llindelyn's lucky arrow?  And does
Furnelaine truly not need your help against those cave bears?  It's for you
to find out!


=========================
Enhanced Mutamin's Garden
=========================

This component modifies the field east of Beregost's temple, known informally
as Mutamin's Garden.  Basilisk encounters will be a little more frequent now,
so keep those potions and scrolls ready!

There are also three new petrified creatures you can restore if you feel so
inclined, but be aware that not all of them may be friendly or thankful...


=========================
Enhanced Ramazith's Tower
=========================

I always found Ramazith's Tower in Baldur's Gate a little disappointing for a
supposedly powerful wizard doing mad experiments.  This mod ups the challenge
a few notches, hopefully making it more memorable.  You may see some new
enemies there...

Hint: Keep in mind that Ramazith is responsible for the petrification of Vail
and his party.  So be careful if you don't want to become the next group of
statues he sells to Felonius Gist...


=======================
Enhanced Ulcaster Ruins
=======================

This component adds a few extra encounters to the Ulcaster Ruins, including a
new type of undead enemy, the Blazing Bones.  You might want to pack some fire
resistance...

Blazing Bones are the undead remains of wizards or priests who were killed by
fire while having Contingency spells prepared to preserve their life.  They
now hate all life and see their flames as a means to cleanse the world.


==================
Enhanced Undercity
==================

This component puts more resistance in the Thieves' Maze and Undercity, the
final areas of BG1.  Also, Sarevok remembered that doors can be locked, you
won't be able to march straight into the temple this time...


======================
Enhanced Xvart Village
======================

This component seeks to make the Xvart Village area west of Nashkel a bit more
of a challenge.  It's still not that hard, but you can expect the xvarts to
put up much more of a fight in the defense of their homes.  Nextlit the Xvart
is now a full-fledged fighter, and the xvarts will be more numerous.  They
also now have a few shamans and adepts aiding them in battle, and have learned
to set up some simple traps for the unwary of foot...


====================
Enhanced Zombie Farm
====================

The farms north of the river were a quite boring area, with just a bunch of
zombies to slay for some pitiful gold and experience.  This modification tries
to turn it into something more exciting.

The first part plays exactly as before, except that the zombies now have the
stats and defenses of ju-ju zombies, making them fairly dangerous.  You still
have to slay all twenty and collect your reward from Wenric.

However, during the final chapter of BG1, Wenric will come looking for you
with dire news, something else has invaded the peaceful farmlands.  If you
decide to help Wenric again you will fight an entirely new encounter at the
farmlands.  And although Wenric has no gold to give this time, there might be
a karmic reward after all, if you have been good...


=========================
Enhanced Isle of Balduran
=========================

This small enhancement adds one new encounter near the shipwreck on the
island.  You will also meet more resistance within the ship itself, so beware!


=======================
Enhanced Durlag's Tower
=======================

While the dreaded tower is already plenty dangerous, I felt there was still
room for some extra excitement!

The fun already starts in the outside area, where you may encounter slightly
more dangerous monsters than just common skeletons...  There will also be more
basilisks roosting on the rooftop, and occasionally one may wander elsewhere,
so better be prepared!  There is also a minor restoration in that a lonely
greater ghoul who was previously trapped on a unreachable ledge has now been
moved to a location where it can be actually encountered.

Most of the upper levels have more ghasts than before, backed up by a few
mohrgs.  Some of the ghasts are evolved ghasts which are slightly tougher and
immune to normal weapons.

On the first dungeon level, all spawn points have been changed to give tougher
and more varied enemies, like dopplegangers, ghasts, wraith spiders, mustard
jellies and more.  The few fixed encounters have also been beefed up, and a
few doom guards have been added here and there.

The scripted encounters of the second level are unchanged, but a few battle
horrors have been placed in previously empty rooms and the crypts in the
southwest corner will now spawn a variety of undead, including skeleton
warriors.

The third level has two more ancient wyverns to fight in the left path, while
the right path has more greater ghasts and a few additional ashirukuru.  The
middle path is left unchanged for now though.  There are also a few more
greater ghouls near the stone heads.

All four elemental challenges have been overhauled.  The Ice Chamber has a
frost giant added to it, and the Earth Chamber's fission slime is no longer
alone, a host of various other jellies has been added.  The Air Chamber has
more invisible stalkers and the enemy layout has been changed, you'll have to
go through them to fight the air aspect.  The biggest change is in the Fire
Chamber, the original challenge has been replaced by a battle with fire
elementals instead (on vanilla BG1, blazing bones).

The final level has many more enemies now, expect a lot more resistance
here.  The Demon Knight now has two slightly tougher than normal skeleton
warriors backing him up, and has better equipment now.  There is also a
minor restoration here: he will now drop the previously unavailable Helm of
Opposite Alignment, as well as an additional full plate mail +1.  (His
appearance on L1 already carried these but was designed to be unkillable.)


==========================
Creature Corrections (BG1)
==========================

Many of BG1's creatures are sloppily defined.  Well over 300 of them have no
proper alignment set (as in none at all, not even neutral) and several more
have alignments that do not match their P&P description (for monsters) or
actions (for humanoids).

Additionally, several monsters were missing their proper attacks, or
implemented them in a bad way.  This component seeks to address all of those.

The alignment part has been externalized (idea borrowed from CamDawg), if you
don't agree with my changes or feel I overlooked something you can edit
config/bg1_alignment_changes.tpa before installing this component.


===============
Missing Dialogs
===============

A lot of characters in BG1 (most notably many commoners in Baldur's Gate) have
dialog files that do not exist, or don't have any dialog assigned at all.
Others have dialogs that sometimes has no valid states (usually after quests
have been completed or a certain point in the game is reached).  This component
adds some flavor text to such characters.


===================
Shop Fixes & Tweaks
===================

The main thing that this component does is replace the unrealistically large
stacks of Large Shields +1 that some shops (most notably the Friendly Arm
Inn and the Nashkel shop) carry.  At the Sword Coast magic items are
relatively uncommon, and it makes no sense that a shop carrying otherwise
mundane equipment should have a stack of five enchanted large shields.  I
consider this more a bug fix than a tweak.

Another thing this component does is add a few copies of hard to get items
to the Thunderhammer smithy.  These are the War hammer +1, Long Bow +1 and
Splint Mail +1.  A Large Shield +1 is also available, to make up for the fact
that other shops no longer carry it.

This component also adds a few 4th level spell scrolls to Thalantyr's
inventory, so your 7th level wizard will no longer be running around without
any spells to fill their 4th level slot until you finish Cloakwood.  In
addition, Thalantyr will also have a Bracers of Defense A.C. 7 for sale.

Finally this component moves two items that seem out of place in the
Thunderhammer Smithy to Black Lily's store in the thieves' guild in Baldur's
Gate instead.  These are the Shadow Armor +3 and the Dagger of Venom.


=======================
BG1 Miscelaneous Tweaks
=======================

This is a collection of small tweaks and enhancements to make certain aspects
of BG1 more convenient or simply more interesting.  Some of these might
perhaps be turned into full enhancements and given their own component in the
future, but for now they are collected here.

The list of changes:
- Chase at the Lion's Way and Fahrington in the Spider Wood tend to blend into
  the background if you don't have blue circles on.  This moves them slightly
  to a position where they stand out more.  (And in Chase's case, also feels
  more appropriate to his drama queen dialog.)
- The ranger Gerde in the Fishing Village does not spawn until you have talked
  to Fenten in Baldur's Gate.  The ankhegs she wants you to kill spawn after
  talking to her (east and a bit north of her).  There will be six of them, so
  watch out.  Finally, her trigger to see if you did her quest has been
  changed to one that is (hopefully) more reliable.
- The Talos-worshipping fishermen won't turn hostile through dialog anymore.
  This prevents them from needlessly being mowed down by your party AI scripts
  kicking in after the quest has been resolved.  (They will still go hostile
  if attacked.)
- Farmer Brun won't run into the woods anymore if you happen to fight ankhegs
  near him.
- The ankheg north of Tenya's hut won't spawn until after you talked to Quinn
  in Baldur's Gate.  Nester's dagger (dagg06) has been given a unique icon
  (lifted from Icewind Dale) and description to make it stand out a bit more.
  (And yes, it really is a masterwork dagger now.  No, you can't get it
  enchanted.)
- Hentold's Quest uses a unique dagger (with an icon lifted from Icewind Dale)
  instead of the supposedly one of a kind Heart of the Golem.  This is a bit
  of a restoration of sorts as the unique dagger (dagg08) was already in the
  game.  I did make it a little more tempting to keep it, though...
  (I might turn this into a full quest enhancement sometime, with the revenant
  stalking you if you keep the dagger...)


=====================
MiH Item Pack for BG2
=====================

This component installs the Made in Heaven item pack for Baldur's Gate 2.
Most of the items from the BG1 Item Pack will reappear in BG2: A few are in
Irenicus' dungeon, and you might find some for sale in Waukeen's Promenade or
Trademeet.  The majority of them will have been tracked down for you by Brokk
who will be glad to return them to you - if you reimburse him, of course.  He
has also found a couple of new items you might be interested in.

Other new items will be found all over Amn and Tethyr, you might see some in
a dungeon here and there, or for sale in certain places.  Some will be used
against you in encounters both old and new, so beware!


=====================
Enhanced Ancient Tomb
=====================

These are the Netherese catacombs underneath the Graveyard District, including
Bodhi's lair.  All spawn points have been altered, those around the large
cocoon spawn all kinds of spiders, those in the southern tombs spawn various
undead creatures.

During the raids on Bodhi's lair (both during chapter 3 and chapter 6) you
will meet more opposition, and one level-scaled encounter with an illogical
activation point (you were unlikely to trigger it unless you explore very
throroughly or still had business in the southern tomb) has now been split
into two separate encounters.  Should you go into the southern tomb during
chapter six you will encounter a horde of wraith spiders as well.  And who
knows, something else might be lurking in there...


=======================
Enhanced Copper Coronet
=======================

This actually mostly affects the sewers between the Copper Coronet and the
Slave Stockade, which had several encounters I felt were out of place.  You'll
now be seeing vermin like gibberlings and kobolds, spiders, and slimes.

There were a few creatures in the arena that are black bears by name and
stats, but had a troll animation.  This has been changed to black bear.


======================
Enhanced Lower Reaches
======================

The Lower Reaches are the old sewers below the Temple District, especially the
Netherese ruins where the Rift Device is stored.  I felt the gibberling and 
yuan-ti encounters there were out of place, so you will now see different enemies,
mostly spiders, slimes and undead.  The hand trap will now summon wraith
spiders, and the high level trap will summon undead, not beholders.  After
all the Unseeing Eye wants the Rift Device to be found, so why should he
hinder you?  A new encounter with some mohrgs has also been added.

The other area changed by this component is the Undead City down the Pit of
the Faithless, which will now have a several more undead to fight.


======================
Enhanced Shadow Temple
======================

The Shadow Temple is the ruined temple of Amaunator near Imnesvale, where the
Shade Lord now rules.  I felt there actually weren't that many shadows here,
for a place supposedly overrun with shadows.  When poking around I found it's
mostly because the spawn points here did not use spawngrp.2da, unlike most
other spawn points in BG2.  I changed that, and now you will see many more
shadows here.  I also added a few extra fixed encounters inside the temple.


==========================
Creature Corrections (BG2)
==========================

Unlike BG1, there are already many creature fixes for BG2 available (I
recommend the G3 Fixpack and Oversight), and I do not wish to do what they
already do.  However, a few creatures have been overlooked in my opinion.

This fixpack mostly fixes the same things as the BG1 version: ankhegs, greater
basiliks, slimes, wraith spiders and winter wolves now get their proper attacks
and stats.  Since these encounters are fairly rare in BG2, you might not note
much of a difference.


===================================
More Varied Level-Scaled Encounters
===================================

BG2 features several encounters scaled to the party's current level, usually
summoned by an undetectable trap in a dungeon.  These encounters have four
'tiers' determined by CHARNAME's current XP.  However, each tier has only one
encounter, so an experienced player will know what they get.

This modification replaces these trap scripts by brand new ones which
introduce more possible encounters per 'tier', so things are a little less
predictable for experienced players.  For novice players this also has the
advantage that if an encounter is too hard, reloading might give a different
one.

These are the generic changes, the full details are in a separate readme file:

- The golem spawning script will now spawn more varied golems, including
  bone-, flesh-, and sand golems which the old script never spawned.  (It was
  restricted to adamantine-, clay-, iron- and stone golems.)
- The mind flayer spawning script will spawn less ulitharids, but more common
  mind flayers and they are more likely to have umber hulks with them.
- The generic monster spawning script (used mostly in Spellhold) will no
  longer spawn yuan-ti, but will mostly spawn elementals and elemental-kin,
  which I feel are more appropriate.  It does still occasionally spawn
  minotaurs and umber hulks though, and may also occasionally spawn a few
  basilisks so be prepared!
- The troll spawning script will spawn less spirit trolls, I find these things
  highly annoying to deal with, and too many of them interrupt the flow of
  the game.  Instead you'll see more common-, giant- and spectral trolls.
- The undead spawning script will no longer spawn liches at the highest tier;
  I feel liches should be unique and not random encounters.  Instead, the
  highest tier may now spawn slayer shadows or a death tyrant.
- The undead spawning script will also no longer spawn bone golems as they are
  golems, not undead.  Instead, the script may now spawn some new types of
  undead including mohrgs and eyes of fear and flame.
- The vampire spawning script will now occasionally have the vampires be
  accompanied by vampiric wolves.


===================
Unique Borok's Fist
===================

The war hammers Aishideena +2 and Borok's Fist +2 are identical in all but
name; both are +2 warhammers that deal +1 electical damage.

This component modifies Borok's Fist to be a unique weapon.  Its enchantment
will be lowered to +1, but in return it gets an approximation of the 3E
'Shocking Burst' property: On 70% of all hits it will deal +1d4 electrical
damage, and on 10% of all hits it will deal an additional +1d10 damage. (These
are cumulative, if it deals the +1d10 it also deals the +1d4.)


==================================================
Allow Divine Spell Scrolls to Paladins and Rangers
==================================================

This component allows paladins and rangers in Icewind Dale to use respectively
cleric- and druid scrolls, simple as that.


========================
Improved Healing Potions
========================

The Potion of Extra Healing and Spirit Essence in Icewind Dale are much weaker
than their counterparts in Baldur's Gate 2.  This component makes them
equivalent to their BG2 versions, 27 HP for a Potion of Healing (was 16) and
40 HP for a Spirit Essence (was 25).  This makes the game a little easier.

Alternatively this mod allows you to set your own custom value for both
potions.


==========================
Alternative Druid XP Table
==========================

Tired of your druid being stuck at level 14 while the rest of your party is
gaining epic abilities left and right?  This component will reduce the
ridiculously high 3 million XP speed bump at level 15 to a much more sane
value, and progresses from there.  From level 15 onward, druids will gain
levels at a speed somewhere between a cleric and a fighter.


=========================
Versatile Light Crossbows
=========================

Another house rule of that GM friend of mine, this modification lets
single-class mages use light crossbows.


========================
Alternative Stat Bonuses
========================

Under D&D 2E rules (which BG and IWD use), for most stats a character had to
have at least a 16 or higher score to notice any tangible effect.  There was
no difference between a 10, 12 or 14 except in how easy it was to get up to
16.  In 3E rules this was changed so that stats started having an effect at a
score of 12 or higher.

This component implements a hybrid of the 2E and 3E rules (since full 3E is
not possible within the engine).  Characters will notice an effect from a
score of 12 or higher in a stat, and the effects of extremely high stats (19
or more) are tempered somewhat.


=========================
Alaghar of Clangeddin Kit
=========================

This component introduces a new cleric kit, the Alaghar of Clangeddin.  The
alaghor are specialty priests of Clangeddin Silverbeard, the Father of Battle
and primary dwarven war god.  The kit is only available to dwarven clerics.

Advantages:
- May place up to 2 proficiency points in weapons and maximum in fighting styles.
- Alaghor strike undead creatures with +2 to hit and damage.
- Alaghor can memorize and cast the unique spells Silverbeard, Rockburst and
  Axe Storm of Clangeddin at appropriate levels (1st, 3rd and 7th, respectively).
- May cast Strength (self only) once per day every 5 levels (starts at 1st level
  with one use).
- At 7th level, alaghor make at least three attacks every two rounds with any
  weapon they can wield.  (This is not cumulative with weapon specialization.)
- At 13th level, alaghor make at least two attacks per round with any weapon
  they can wield.

Disadvantages:
- Race restricted to dwarf.
- Alignment restricted to lawful good or lawful neutral.
- Alaghor cannot turn undead."


=====================================
Make Yeslick an Alaghar of Clangeddin
=====================================

Requires the Alaghar of Clangeddin Kit.

If your game includes BG1 (Tutu, BGT, BGEE or EET), this component will give
Yeslick a slightly modified version of the Alaghar of Clangeddin kit that is
not available to players.  He will still be a fighter/cleric as always.


=========================================
Relative Stat Bonuses from Equipped Items
=========================================

Several items, most notable the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength and the Gloves of
Dexterity, set a certain stat to a fixed score while equipped.  This opens a
number of exploits, allowing a character to get a huge stat increase from a
single item while at the same time making the item nearly useless to
characters that already have a decent score in that stat.

This mod makes such items more like their 3E counterparts where they give a
bonus to a stat score instead.  The conversion is as follows:

	18	=> +2
	19, 20	=> +3
	21, 22	=> +4
	23, 24	=> +5
	25	=> +6

Items with a limited duration (like potions) and spells are not affected.


================
Cap Item Charges
================

This component caps the number of charges in wands, staves and the like to
20, or a user-defined value.


===================
Arcane Spell Tweaks
===================

This component is a small collection of minor tweaks to a number of arcane
spells.

- Shield:
  Grants +2 AC instead of base AC 4.  (Not cumulative with itself.)
  This also affects the Shield Amulet, and the Ring of Shielding in Icewind
  Dale.

- Protection from Normal Missiles:
  Also grants +25% missile damage resistance to missiles it doesn't outright
  block.

- Disintegrate:
  Will still deal 5d6 damage if the target makes a successful saving throw.


===================
Divine Spell Tweaks
===================

This component is a small collection of minor tweaks to a number of divine
spells.

- Shillelagh:
  The shillelagh counts as a magical weapon with a +1 enchantment and deals
  2d4 damage.
  In Icewind Dale this is already the default, no change there.

- Barkskin:
  Barkskin grants an AC bonus of +2 to +5 instead of setting a fixed base AC,
  and is not cumulative with itself.
  This also affects the Staff of the Woodlands in BG2.

- Flame Blade:
  The flame blade deals pure fire damage and improves with level, like the 3E
  version.  It is also +4 to hit and counts as a +2 weapon for purposes of
  what it can hit.  The flame blade is wielded as a scimitar, but there is no
  penalty for non-proficiency.


=======================
Improved Healing Spells
=======================

This component alters healing spells to act like their 3E counterparts.

- Cure Light Wounds:	1d8 + 1/level (max. +5)
- Cure Medium Wounds:	2d8 + 1/level (max. +10)
- Cure Moderate Wounds:	3d8 + 1/level (max. +15)
- Cure Serious Wounds:	4d8 + 1/level (max. +20)
- Cure Critical Wounds:	5d8 + 1/level (max. +25)
- Heal:			10/level (no max.)

This makes healing spells more random and a bit weaker at the start of BG1 and
IWD1, but in the long run much more effective, and a more viable choice
compared to other spells.

This component will find Cure Medium/Moderate spells added by mods, like
IWDification for BG2, provided that they are properly added to spell.ids.


=========================
Additional Paladin Powers
=========================

This component gives paladins a few more innate powers.

- Paladins that can Lay on Hands (true-class Paladin and Cavalier) get an
  additional use every seventh paladin level, up to 5/day at level 28.
- All paladins except the Undead Hunter can Smite Evil, this deals 1d6 points
  of magical damage to a single evil creature.  Every third paladin level
  raises the damage by another 1d6, up to 11d6 at level 30.  Every fifth
  paladin level gives another use per day, up to 5/day at level 20.
- Undead Hunters can Smite Undead.  This only works on undead creatures, but
  it works regardless of alignment.  Other than that it functions the same as
  Smite Evil.

The Smite Evil/Undead ability was based on Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter.

Currently this component only works on games with the BG2/ToB engine.


=======================
Other Item Improvements
=======================

This is a small collection of changes and (hopefully) improvements to items
that are shared by BG1, BG2 and IWD1.  The list is as follows:

- Potion of Invulnerability (potn11):
  This potion now works as the P&P version, granting +2 to AC and saves, and
  immunity to normal weapons.
- Elixer of Health (potn17):
  This potion will now also cure blindness and deafness.
- Wand of Magic Missiles (wand03):
  This wand will fire two magic missiles now, as per P&P.
  (The BG1 version of wand12 is deliberately left untouched.)
- Wand of Lightning (wand07):
  Now fires just one lightning bolt instead of six.  (BG2 only)


=====================
Known Bugs and Issues
=====================

- Enhanced Candlekeep: When helping you, Deder can detect traps but not disarm
  them.  This seems to be an engine limitation.  Since all traps in that area
  are easily avoidable, I don't think it's a big issue.

- Item Pack: Evithyan's Blade is actually +5 against all elves, not just drow.
  Internally drow are just elves with a different animation, there is no way I
  know to make the bonus more specific.

- Alaghar of Clangeddin: The three specialty spells do not have unique icons
  yet.  Silverbeard uses the icon of Armor, Rockburst uses the icon and
  projectile of Skull Trap, and Axe Storm of Clangeddin uses the icon of
  Haste.  Help with making unique icons and projectiles would be greatly
  appreciated!
