@0    = ~Ugh...  You... saved Lurch?~
@1    = ~That I did.  What about it?~
@2    = ~Meh, just thought you might have something valuable on you.~
@3    = ~You... not hate Lurch?  Hate Lurch for being gnoll?  You... noble.  Maybe not all humans so bad.  Lurch will think on this...~
@4    = ~...Lurch found gem.  Pretty gem.  Lurch give to you, yes?  Lurch thank you for rescue!~
@5    = ~A Redeemed Gnoll?

I saved a gnoll named Lurch from being a pidgin toilet for the next few centuries.  This noble act made him think on his disposition towards humans and he left peacefully after giving me a gem he had found.  I wonder if he'll be good from now on?~
@6    = ~You not get Lurch's gem!  Humans always attack Lurch for being gnoll!  Lurch kill you all!~
