@0    = ~The great and powerful Trish is free!  To whom does she owe this pleasure?  You perhaps, little <PRO_RACE>?~
@1    = ~Were you hoping for a reward perhaps?  Well, too bad!  The great and powerful Trish has better things to do than reward those beneath her!~
@2    = ~In fact, for seeing the great and powerful Trish in that helpless petrified state, I think you should die!~
@3    = ~An Unthankful Mage
